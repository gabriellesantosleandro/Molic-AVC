","Why the result is missing","Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.","Null or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""specimen unsatisfactory"".   

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.

","Who and/or what the observation is about","The patient, or group of patients, location, device, organization, procedure or practitioner this observation is about and into whose or what record the observation is placed. If the actual focus of the observation is different from the subject (or a sample of, part, or region of the subject), the `focus` element or the `code` itself specifies the actual focus of the observation.","One would expect this element to be a cardinality of 1..1. The only circumstance in which the subject can be missing is when the observation is made by a device that does not know the patient. In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated. The subject of an Observation may in some cases be a procedure.  This supports the regulatory inspection use case where observations are captured during inspections of a procedure that is being performed (independent of any particular patient or whether patient related at all).","Observations have no value if you don't know who or what they're about.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Observation.subject",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

The focus of an observation could also be an existing condition,  an intervention, the subject's diet,  another observation of the subject,  or a body structure such as tumor or implanted device.   An example use case would be using the Observation resource to capture whether the mother is trained to change her child's tracheostomy tube. In this example, the child is the patient of record and the mother is the focus.","Typically, an observation is made about the subject - a patient, or group of patients, location, or device - and the distinction between the subject and what is directly measured for an observation is specified in the observation code itself ( e.g., ""Blood Glucose"") and does not need to be represented separately using this element.

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.

- If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by the `code`.
-  *CodeableConcept* with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the `code` defines a coded value.
-  *Attachment* is used if the observation result value is a binary file such as an image.  If the observation result value is derived from the binary file (for example 'X' detected and here is the the proof in this image), the binary file may be directly represented using *DocumentReference* and referenced by `derivedFrom`.
- The usage of valueReference is restricted to the MolecularSequence resource when used as a definitional resource, not as a patient-specific finding. .

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
